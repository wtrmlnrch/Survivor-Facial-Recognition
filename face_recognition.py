"""Project Description
Name: HW 1 Face Recognition
Authors: Sarte & Sustaita
Professor: Dr. Eicholtz
Class: AI 3 - csc4510
Due Date: 9/25/2024

This project will work to build a PCA with k-means clustering to predict how compeitors wil perform in 
the game survivor based on a face-recogniton model. Who's face is most similar to a survivor host and 
there for may become one? 

Goal:
Face recognition is a classic real-world application for **_unsupervised learning_** techniques. 
In this assignment, you will work in pairs to develop Python code that leverages principal component
analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering along with supervised learning methods such as nearest neighbors
and neural networks to explore an image dataset related to the reality TV show _Survivor_.
